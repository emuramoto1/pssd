# The Big Idea
Our project is designed to help Babson College students track their progress towards a degree and identify possible concentration paths. Through this project, we wish to explore student education and come up with a product that can help minimize the stress that comes with choosing courses. The minimum viable product would be a website that would ask for the user’s transcript so that the website can identify what classes the user has already taken so far and what classes the user has to take in the future in order to graduate in a timely manner. The website would also give the user different concentration options and provide specific future courses that the user can take to fulfill those concentrations. A stretch goal would be to also take in the user’s grades for each of their courses and determine an optimal concentration for them.

# Learning Goals 
Our team goal is to learn how to effectively communicate and collaborate on a python project. We also want to give back to the Babson community through the creation of our project, by creating a viable product for all undergraduate students to utilize. 

* Lina: My personal goal for this project is to further learn how to write Python code in a succinct and efficient manner. I also want to learn how to work on a coding project in a team setting and learn how to share and collaborate. I also wish to gain more experience in using a coding language to solve non-mathematical problems. 

* Emily: My individual goal is to gain more experience with Python overall. Moreover, this project will require me to think from scratch on how to use Python to solve an issue, a skill that I think will be valuable in my professional career.

* James: My personal goal for this project is to advance my understanding of Python. I want to learn how to utilize documents (PDFs) and extract meaningful data from these documents. I also want to learn how to take that data and compare it to another data source to create recommendations for the user. 

# Implementation Plan
 Our implementation plan is to find a python library that helps with the extraction of information from PDFs. After finding that library the team will need to develop the code to extract strings from the portions that are relevant on their unofficial transcripts. 


We will need to create a file that has all of Babson’s graduation requirements in order to determine whether an individual is on track to graduate as well as the classes that they are still missing for their degree requirements. We will also need to compile Babson’s course listings into a CSV file in order to provide recommendations. Lastly, we will need to create a data frame that has various concentration requirements, to identify which ones the user is the closest to completing. 


Lastly, we will need to understand HTML to create a website that’s integrated with our python code, so users will be able to use it.


# Project Schedule
First, we will work on extracting Babson’s graduation requirements into a readable Python file as well as all of Babson’s available courses. We will also work on creating the concentration lists within Python with all of the appropriate courses. 
Then, we will start to brainstorm on the website draft and try to determine the UI and UX aspects of it. Then, we will start working on writing the code that will ask for the user’s input and translate the user’s unofficial transcript into readable information. Afterwards, we will work on writing code that will analyze the unofficial transcript and provide the classes that the user is missing in order to graduate. Lastly, we will try to include information about the concentrations and how they match the user’s past education experience. 

# Collaboration Plan
As of now, we plan to collaborate by splitting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility to chat via messenger and video call in case of coding hurdles or questions about our project. We think this particular organizational structure will be good as one member is in a different time-zone and finding a time to meet may be difficult with different class schedules and previous engagements.


In terms of a software development methodology, we think that an agile development methodology is most appropriate. Given that this methodology focuses on creating mini-iterations, we will be able to improve efficiency and minimize risks early on in the project. 

# Risks
The biggest risk to the success of our project is effective and efficient collaboration. Our team consists of members from different time zones and it is all of our first time working on a coding project together from a virtual standpoint. 


The second biggest risk is our understanding of Python. We are all beginners so there is much to learn to create this project. We are unsure if we will be able to learn everything we need to implement every feature that we desire in the given time frame — as it is relatively short.

# Additional Course Content
Some additional topics that may be useful to cover in class is how to import different libraries into VS code, as we have encountered issues before while trying to utilize libraries like Numpy.


Another topic that would be interesting to learn would be how to import a pdf into Python and turn it into Python code, as we will need to analyze the user’s unofficial transcripts.
